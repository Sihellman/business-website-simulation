This is a model business website that I am currently working on. I am considering making the design more consistent, and adding CSS to the Service page, among other improvments.

I initially thought that the tabs would respond faster if all the webpages were in one html file, but now I'm in the process of making shorter files to ease navigation.

Parallax.js is the raw code of the library rellax, that would not import, and I am currently researching this issue. var rellax is instantiated at the end of Parallax.js.
